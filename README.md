# Loki ðŸŸ¢

#### Loki allows developers to step through their repository history and enter a virtual environment at any point in their repo's lifetime in order to test previous features, replicate bugs, or simply revert to old versions without the complexity of git commands or compromising the current state of your project. 

#### How it works:
- Move Loki into your device's path or into a specified repo of your choosing
- Run Loki 
- Sort through the history of your project, ordered by the following
	- Month ---> List of commits by day within month ---> Commits include message, hash, date and user
- Select commit
- Enter virtual environment with your choice of text editor, with the code base of that commit
- Make changes with no effect to the current state of your project
- Exit environment at anytime
