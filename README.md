![usages](./resources/usage.gif)

**Loki** is a tool for developers and students with minimal Git experience, that allows you to step through your repository's history and enter a virtual environment at any commit in your project's lifetime. You can review older versions, test and replicate previous features, or explore past implementations without the need for complex Git commands or risking changes to your current project state.

## Features:
- Browse your project's commit history with details: Date â†’ Commit Message â†’ Hash â†’ Author.
- Select any commit to load its codebase in a temporary branch.
- Open the code in your preferred text editor.
- Make changes, test, or run old code with no impact on your current projects HEAD.
- Exit the environment to return to your project's latest state.

## Requirements:
- **GCC**
- **Libgit2**
- **Ncurses**
- **Make** 

## Installation Instructions 

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   brew install gcc libgit2 ncurses
   ```

   **Linux**
   ```zshrc
   sudo apt-get install build-essential libgit2-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
   ```

3. **Clone the Loki repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:alhakimiakrm/Loki.git
   cd Loki
   ```

4. **Build Loki:**

   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Usage

1. Move the `loki` executable to your desired project directory. (i.e. ```cp ./loki ../example-project```)
   
2. Run Loki with:

   ```bash
   ./loki
   ```

4. Choose your preferred text editor.

5. Use the arrow keys to navigate through your commit history and press `Enter` to select a commit and enter the codebase in a temporary environment.

6. After you're done, save your changes and exit the editor to return to the latest state of your project. None of the changes you make in your temp enviornment will apply to your project's latest state.
